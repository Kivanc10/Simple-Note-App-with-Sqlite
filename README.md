# Simple-Note-App-with-Sqlite

- Simple android note app that contains a two-steps authentication process to create a user. After that, the app allows us to add, delete, update notes belong to that user thanks to the SQLite database. 
<br>

- It looks like the default note app used on an android device. The app I designed almost presents the same facilities to the user as the default app on Android devices.
<br>

- The note app also is known you while you're logged in and navigate you to inside the app without the authentication process

<br>

- The app reminds you when even you logged out and navigates you to login page with yours username and password.
